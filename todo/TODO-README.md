> Technical Requirements / Notes
1. You’ve been provided “starter code” for this phase. Copy the starter code folder contents into your repository to use as your starting point for the application. We’ll be refactoring this to fulfill the requirements.

1. Convert the architecture from Class Based Components into Functional Components
1. Apply styling and layout using React Bootstrap Components
1. Ensure the current functionality works unchanged
1. Manage state using the useState() hook
1. Use a useEffect() hook to change the title of the browser with the complete/incomplete counts
1. Use a useEffect() hook to pre-load the seeded To Do Items
1. Match the provided mockup for the design
1. Use react-bootstrap components and theming
>Some interactivity notes:
1. Each item in list should show the text of the item as well as the assignee
1. When clicked, toggle the “complete” status of the item.
1. Items should be styled differently when complete/incomplete making their status visually obvious
